This is a WIP solver for the puzzle game of Trees and Tents.

The puzzles are being obtained from:
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/tents.html
using selenium, and some not too clear/shady code.

The puzzle generation credit goes to respective authors.

It seeks to solve the puzzle using a model-based agent and oldschool propositional logic.
